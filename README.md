# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## This is my prework study guide that I will be using throughout my coding bootcamp.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for doing this is to be able to expand my computer skills and my knowledge. I'm also doing this to better myself and to hopefully one day make this my career.
- I did this project to challenge myself to do somthing that I have never done before and to push myself to see if I could do it.  
- I didn't really solve any problems during this project as I was building a website.
- I learned how to trouble shoot and to debug code. I also learned the frustration and heartache that comes with coding as well as the joys that come with it.
